# Hack The Box Season 8 Writeups

A curated set of writeups for Hack The Box Season 8 challenges. Each markdown file contains notes, steps, and key takeaways for a specific machine or challenge.

## Contents

Season 8 machine writeups live in the `Season - 8 ` directory (note the trailing space in the folder name). Fortress writeups live in `Fortress/`. Metadata below is taken from each writeup header; when a difficulty was missing, it was sourced from the public HTB machine page (Faraday is a Fortress and has no public listing).
